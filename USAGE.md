# Usage Explaination

### This guide is still a work in progress 

The purpose of this software is to *simulate the package & class structure of OpenFTC's EasyOpenCV and a little bit of the FTC SDK*,
while also providing OpenCV functionality and a simple GUI. By simulating the aforementioned structure, it allows the imports, class names, etc.
to be the same as they would if you were using the FTC SDK with EasyOpenCV, allowing you to simply copy paste your vision code
onto your Android Studio project once you want to transfer it to a robot.<br/>

All of the pipeline classes **should be** placed under the *org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode* package, in the *TeamCode* module. This way, they will be
automatically detected by the simulator and will be selectionable from the GUI.

*(Also, the simulator already comes by default with some EasyOpenCV samples)*<br/>

To create a new java class, follow these steps:<br/>
1) In the project files menu, open the TeamCode module
2) Find the *org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode* package and right click on it
3) On the context menu, click on *New > Java Class*
4) A new menu will appear, type a name and make sure the *Class* option is selected
5) Once you have typed a name, press enter and the class will be created

Here's a quick gif illustrating these steps:<br/>

If you want your class to be a pipeline, it **should also** extend the EOCV's OpenCvPipeline abstract class and override the processFrame() method.<br/><br/>
Here's a empty pipeline template, with the SamplePipeline class we created before:

```java
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode;

import org.opencv.core.Mat;
import org.openftc.easyopencv.OpenCvPipeline;

public class SamplePipeline extends OpenCvPipeline {

    @Override
    public void init(Mat input) {
        /* Executed once, when the pipeline is selected */
    }

    @Override
    public Mat processFrame(Mat input) {
        /* Executed each frame, the returned mat will be the one displayed */
        /* Processing and detection stuff */
        return input; // Return the input mat
                      // (Or a new, processed mat)
    }

    @Override
    public void onViewportTapped() {
        /*
         * Executed everytime when the pipeline view is tapped/clicked.
         * This is executed from the UI thread, so whatever we do here
         * we must do it quickly.
         */
    }

}
```
